## Description
WalkieDoggyProject is a web application designed to facilitate dog walking sessions between dog owners. It offers a platform for dog owners to connect, schedule, and coordinate dog walks in their local area. Whether you want to find a walking companion for your furry friend or meet other dog owners in your community, this app is here to help!

This project is the final project for the Computer Science program at the Open University of Israel, developed by a team of five friends who are passionate about dogs and technology. We have combined our skills and knowledge to create a user-friendly and intuitive web application that brings dog owners together and enhances their dog walking experience.

We believe that walking dogs should be a social and enjoyable activity, not just for the dogs but also for the owners. With WalkieDoggyProject, we aim to foster a sense of community among dog owners, allowing them to connect, share experiences, and form new friendships.

We hope that our app not only serves as a successful project for our Computer Science studies but also becomes a valuable tool for dog owners everywhere. By creating a platform where dog owners can meet, schedule walks, and build relationships, we aim to improve the well-being of dogs and promote a stronger bond between owners and their furry companions.

Thank you for your interest in our project, and we hope you enjoy using WalkieDoggyProject as much as we enjoyed developing it!
